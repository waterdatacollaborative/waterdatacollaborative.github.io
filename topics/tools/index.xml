      <title>Better Data Quality for Better Water Equity: Transforming EAR data </title>

      <description>Every year, the State of California gathers data about water usage and production from all of its public water systems via Electronics Annual Reports (EARs). For instance, consider Dataset #8 in the Recommended Challenge Datasets: this dataset lists information taken from the EAR for each public water system (PWS) for each month of the year, including water production/delivery, water quality, and rates. In principle, this dataset is a treasure-trove of knowledge for government employees seeking to study, optimize, and understand water distribution in California.</description>

      <description>Saving staff time by building a model that identifies Electronic Annual Reports (EARs) with errors. Can we learn more about contributing factors through geographic visualization?
