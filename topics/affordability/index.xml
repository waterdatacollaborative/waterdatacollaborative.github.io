      <description>Communities that are economically disadvantaged are most vulnerable to high water prices, and safety and availability issues.
This project combines information from the Public Water Services (PWS), US Census data and water utility rates to study the affordability of drinking water in California.
To fill the gaps in the existing data and engage and empowered the communities most affected, a proof-of-concept implementation for a survey is included.
