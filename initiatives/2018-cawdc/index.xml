      <description>Lead Levels in San Francisco Schools San Francisco Unified School District tested the school&amp;rsquo;s drinking water for lead last year. This map shows the highest lead levels detected at each school based on multiple sample sites and dates.
There is no safe level of lead, especially for children. Even small amounts can lower IQ. Damage from lead exposure is irreversible.
Take action with CALPIRG&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Get The Lead Out:Back to School Toolkit.</description>

      <title>Better Data Quality for Better Water Equity: Transforming EAR data </title>

      <description>Every year, the State of California gathers data about water usage and production from all of its public water systems via Electronics Annual Reports (EARs). For instance, consider Dataset #8 in the Recommended Challenge Datasets: this dataset lists information taken from the EAR for each public water system (PWS) for each month of the year, including water production/delivery, water quality, and rates. In principle, this dataset is a treasure-trove of knowledge for government employees seeking to study, optimize, and understand water distribution in California.</description>

      <description>Communities that are economically disadvantaged are most vulnerable to high water prices, and safety and availability issues.
This project combines information from the Public Water Services (PWS), US Census data and water utility rates to study the affordability of drinking water in California.
To fill the gaps in the existing data and engage and empowered the communities most affected, a proof-of-concept implementation for a survey is included.
